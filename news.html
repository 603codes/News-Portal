        <h2 >Kathmandu Launches Electric Bus Fleet to Combat Air Pollution</h2><br>
        <p >
        By Ramesh Adhikari, Staff Reporter<br>
        In a significant move towards sustainable urban transport, Kathmandu
        Metropolitan City unveiled its first fleet of electric buses on
        Sunday, aiming to reduce air pollution and modernize public
        transportation.<br />
        The introduction of these electric buses marks a pivotal step in
        Kathmandu's efforts to address escalating air quality concerns and
        <img src="img/Elecvec.jpg" style="float: right;margin-left: 10px;" alt="">
          traffic congestion. The initiative aligns with the city's broader
          environmental goals and commitment to green infrastructure. The new
          fleet comprises 40 electric buses, each equipped with zero-emission
          technology and designed for the city's challenging terrain. The buses
          will operate on major routes, including Ratnapark to Kalanki and
          Koteshwor to Sundhara, providing residents with a cleaner and more
          efficient mode of transportation.<br />
          Mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya, during the inauguration ceremony at
          Tundikhel, stated, "This initiative is a milestone in our journey
          towards a greener Kathmandu. By adopting electric buses, we aim to set
          an example for sustainable urban mobility." The project, a
          collaboration between the Kathmandu Metropolitan City Office and the
          Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, received funding
          support from the Asian Development Bank. The buses were manufactured
          by a joint venture between Nepal's Eco Vehicle Industries and China's
          GreenTech Motors.<br />
          Local commuters have expressed optimism about the new service. Sita
          Ram, a daily commuter, shared, "The electric buses are quieter and
          more comfortable. It's a refreshing change from the old diesel
          buses."<br />
          Environmental experts have lauded the move, highlighting its potential
          impact on reducing the city's carbon footprint. Dr. Anjali Thapa, an
          environmental scientist at Tribhuvan University, noted, "Transitioning
          to electric public transport is crucial for improving air quality and
          public health in Kathmandu."<br />
          The electric bus initiative represents Kathmandu's commitment to
          sustainable development and environmental stewardship. City officials
          plan to expand the fleet to 100 buses within the next year, further
          enhancing the capital's public transportation network.<br />

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Nepal's National Cricket Team Prepares for ICC World Cup Qualifiers</h2><br>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6">
        By Pratik Sharma, Sports Correspondent<br>
          The Nepal national cricket team is gearing up for the ICC World Cup
          Qualifiers, set to take place in Zimbabwe next month. The team, led by
          <img src="img/cricket.jpg" style="float: right;margin-left: 10px;" alt="">
          captain Sandeep Lamichhane, has been training intensively at the
          Tribhuvan University Cricket Ground in Kirtipur.<br />
          Nepal secured its spot in the qualifiers after a stellar performance in
          the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2, finishing among the top teams in
          the tournament. The squad includes experienced players like Gyanendra
          Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee, alongside promising young talents such
          as Kushal Malla and Aasif Sheikh.<br />
          Coach Jagat Tamata expressed confidence in the team's preparation,
          stating, "We have worked hard to build a balanced side. Our focus is on
          executing our game plan effectively."<br />
          The qualifiers will feature 10 teams competing for two spots in the
          ICC Cricket World Cup 2023. Nepal's first match is scheduled against
          Scotland on June 18.<br />
          Fans are optimistic about Nepal's chances, with many hoping for a
          historic qualification for the World Cup. "This is a golden opportunity
          for Nepali cricket," said avid fan Ramesh Gurung.<br />
            The team will depart for Zimbabwe on June 10, where they will play a series of warm-up matches before the qualifiers begin.
